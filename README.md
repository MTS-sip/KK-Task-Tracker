#### User Story

- AS a developer
- I WANT a Kanban board with a secure login page
- SO THAT I can securely access and manage my work tasks

#### Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN a Kanban board with a secure login page
- WHEN I load the login page
- THEN I am presented with form inputs for username and password
- WHEN I enter my valid username and password
- THEN I am authenticated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and redirected to the main Kanban board page
- WHEN I enter an invalid username or password
- THEN I am presented with an error message indicating that the credentials are incorrect
- WHEN I successfully log in
- THEN a JWT is stored securely in the client's local storage for subsequent authenticated requests
- WHEN I log out
- THEN the JWT is removed from the client's local storage and I am redirected to the login page
- I try to access the Kanban board page without being authenticated
- THEN I am redirected to the login page
- WHEN I remain inactive for a defined period
- THEN my session expires, the JWT is invalidated, and I am redirected to the login page upon my next action
